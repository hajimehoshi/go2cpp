# go2cpp

A converter from Go to C++

## Example

```sh
cd example/helloworld
./run.sh
```

## How does this work?

This tool analyses a Wasm file compiled from Go files, and generates C++ files based on the Wasm file.

## TODO

  * Improving compiling speed by reducing C++ files
  * `net/http`
  * `os`
